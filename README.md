# Java-Physics-Engine
A fully-functional physics engine built from scratch in Java.

#Features
- Polygon-polygon, circle-circle, and polygon-circle collision detection and response
- Kinematics with forces and rotation
- Rigid body dynamics with restitution
- Static objects like walls and ground
- Inertia, mass, and center of gravity
- Object pooling for bodies

#What I learned
- Computational geometry - polygon and circle collision, as well as center of mass and inertia
- Linear algebra - matrix transforms, rotations
